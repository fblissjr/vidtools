# vidtools (aka ffmpeg commands i always forget)

this is just a little tool i made because i always forget the ffmpeg commands i use all the time.

basically it's a collection of presets to make running ffmpeg easier for common tasks.  instead of having to remember the flags and filters every time, i can use this.

right now it can do these things:

*   **resize video:** change the resolution of a video, like making it 50% smaller.
*   **convert format:** change the video format, like from mp4 to gif or mp3.
*   **extract audio:** pull the audio track out of a video file.
*   **extract frames:** grab individual frames from a video as images.
*   **concatenate videos:** join multiple video files together into one.
*   **crop video:** cut out a section of the video frame.
*   **get video info:** show details about a video file using ffprobe.
*   **add subtitles:** burn subtitles directly into a video.
*   **rotate video:** turn a video by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
*   **apply presets:** use saved settings for common tasks.
*   **manage presets:** save, delete, and edit your own presets.

that's pretty much it.  just a helper for ffmpeg stuff.
